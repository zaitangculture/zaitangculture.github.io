# Window Direction Indicator

## Overview

This project displays a dynamic arrow in a web page that points towards the direction of other open windows (or tabs) of the same website.

## Demo

## Website

https://mmiddletonn.github.io/RelativePointers/

(I did not set up any ui to indicate what to do, but just open the webpage in 2 or more instances and arrows/lines will appear)

## How It Works

This website uses JavaScript to calculate the position of the current window relative to other open windows. It then adjusts the direction of a centrally located arrow to point towards these windows. The positions are stored and updated in the browser's local storage, allowing for communication between windows.
