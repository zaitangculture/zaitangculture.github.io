# CanvasSync

## IMPORTANT

I have only gotten this working in chrome, firefox will merely show you the animation

## Demo

## Website

https://mmiddletonn.github.io/CanvasSync/

## How It Works

The website uses JavaScript to create a canvas that dynamically adjusts its size and position based on screen and window dimensions. It continuously renders a visually dynamic orb identically across all web instances, allowing for the illusion of synchronization.
